/// Unified stepper motor interface
///
/// Wraps a driver that interfaces with the motor-controlling hardware and
/// abstracts over it, providing an interface that works the same, no matter
/// what kind of hardware controls the stepper motor.
///
/// You can construct an instance of this type using [`Stepper::from_driver`].
///
/// # Nomenclature
///
/// This structs wraps a software component that interfaces with hardware that
/// controls a stepper motor. That software component is called a "driver",
/// because it "drives" the hardware it interfaces with.
///
/// The driven hardware typically comes in two forms:
///
/// - A low-level chip controlled by STEP and DIR signals, often called a
///   stepper driver (yes, somewhat confusing) or stepper controller.
/// - A higher-level chip, typically controlled through some serial interface,
///   often called a motion controller.
///
/// In practice, a given product can cleanly fall into one of the two camps,
/// both, or anything in between.
///
/// # Hardware capabilities
///
/// Depending on the actual hardware we're interfacing with, we might only have
/// access to the bare minimum functionality (STEP and DIR pins) or high-level
/// motion control features. Since `Stepper` is agnostic on the driver and the
/// hardware it interfaces with, there must be a way to deal with those
/// differing capabilities.
///
/// `Stepper` provides a number of `enable_*` methods that enable access to a
/// specific hardware capability, if the hardware and driver support this. Once
/// that method has been called, the methods that control the hardware
/// capability are available.
///
/// ## Step mode control
///
/// Enable this capability with [`Stepper::enable_step_mode_control`] and use it
/// with [`Stepper::set_step_mode`]. Since not all stepper drivers support
/// microstepping and of those that do, not all support setting it from
/// software, this capability might not be available for all drivers.
///
/// ## Direction control & step control
///
/// Enable direction control with [`Stepper::enable_direction_control`] and use
/// it with [`Stepper::set_direction`]. Enable step control with
/// [`Stepper::enable_step_control`] and use ith with [`Stepper::step`].
///
/// These capabilities are supported by virtually all stepper drivers, but might
/// not be available for motion controllers. Where they are available, they are
/// typically available together. They are modeled as separate capabilities, as
/// to not make any assumptions. If you want to generate steps from software,
/// for example, but control direction via some other means, then you can.
///
/// ## Motion control
///
/// Enable motion control with [`Stepper::enable_motion_control`] and use it
/// with [`Stepper::move_to_position`] and [`Stepper::reset_position`].
///
/// Motion control capability is directly supported by motion control chips, but
/// a software implementation based on direction and step control exists in the
/// [`motion_control`] module, to make the capability available for all drivers.
///
/// [`motion_control`]: crate::motion_control
///
/// # Notes on timer use
///
/// Some of this struct's methods take a timer argument. This is expected to be
/// an implementation of [`fugit_timer::Timer`].
