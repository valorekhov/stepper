//! Traits that can be implemented by Stepper drivers
//!
//! Users are generally not expected to use these traits directly, except to
//! specify trait bounds, where necessary. Please check out [`Stepper`], which
//! uses these traits to provide a unified API.
//!
//! There are two kinds of traits in this module:
//! 1. Those that provide a minimal and low-level interface over a specific
//!    capability (like controlling the microstepping mode).
//! 2. Those that provide an API for enabling these capabilities, taking
//!    ownership of the resources that are required to do so.
//!
//! When constructed, drivers usually do not provide access to any of their
//! capabilities. This means users can specifically enable the capabilities they
//! need, and do not have have to provide hardware resources (like output pins)
//! for capabilities that they are not going to use.
//!
//! This approach also provides a lot of flexibility for non-standard use cases,
//! for example if not all driver capabilities are controlled by software.
//!
