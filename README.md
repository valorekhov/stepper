# Stepper - Universal Stepper Motor Interface

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/stepper.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/stepper) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/stepper/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/stepper) ![CI Build](workflows/CI%20Build/badge.svg)

## About

Stepper aims to provide an interface that abstracts over stepper motor drivers and controllers, exposing high-level hardware features directly where available, or providing software fallbacks where hardware support is lacking.

Right now, Stepper supports the following drivers:

- [DRV8825] ([crate][drv8825-crate], [vendor documentation][drv8825-doc])
- [STSPIN220] ([crate][stspin220-crate], [vendor documentation][stspin220-doc])

[stspin220-doc]: https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stspin220.pdf


Support for more stepper drivers and controllers will be added in the future. Please consider helping out with this effort, if you need support for a driver or controller that is currently missing.

Please refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.rs/stepper) or one of the following guides to learn more:

## Status

Stepper is under active development. Its API is going to change, as more features are added and existing ones are improved. Support for drivers is very limited right now, and support for controllers is non-existent.

The library is usable, but far from mature. There are some known limitations that are documented on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/braun-embedded/stepper/issues). If you find any additional problems, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Stepper is maintained by:

- Hanno Braun ([@hannobraun])
- Jesse Braham ([@jessebraham])


## Usage

Stepper is a library written in Rust and designed for use in Rust projects. It will run on any platform supported by Rust, including microcontrollers.

Add Stepper to your `Cargo.toml` like this:

``` toml
[dependencies.stepper]
version = "0.5" # make sure this is the latest version
```

If you just need to use a specific stepper driver, you can also depend on the crate for that specific driver. For example:

``` toml
[dependencies.drv8825]
version = "0.5" # make sure this is the latest version
```

Please refer to the [API Reference] for more information.
