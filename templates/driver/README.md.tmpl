## About

Rust driver crate for the [{ name | upper }] stepper motor driver. Carrier boards for this chip are [available from Pololu].

This crate is a specialized facade for the [Stepper] library. Please consider using Stepper directly, as it provides drivers for more stepper motor drivers, as well as an interface to abstract over them.

See [Stepper] for more documentation and usage examples.
